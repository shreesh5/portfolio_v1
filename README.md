## Portfolio V1

Hello, there! This repo contains the source code for my [portfolio website](https://www.shreeshnayak.com/), which I built using React and Gatsby.

I was inspired by Maribel and a few others after reading her [blogpost](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-made-my-portfolio-website-blazing-fast-with-gatsby-82ccddc2f671/) on freeCodeCamp.org.  

I'm a big fan of Material UI and hence decided to challeng myself to design my website using only Material UI.

## Tech Stack
